/** func param return caching, like in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation but more stateless than that,
though you could derive continuations from this by including a treemap param in functions
that call eachother and pass that same or forkEdited treemap to deeper calls.
This is a pure math system more like lambdas than continuations, and also pattern-calculus and combinator,
so it doesnt exactly fit into any existing category of functions.
To represent it as lambdas, you'd need a funcall function that takes 2 params,
instead of calling those 2 on eachother directly, to make the reflect ops (l r isleaf isclean) work,
or you could build that into the 2 functions as long as they're never called on anything not
created by combos of such a universal function which would break the reflect ops.
Thats built into λ.e(λ) and λ.e(long,λ) and happens automatically when anything is called on anything.

	That would solve the order problem, but not the problem of
	how to know which are reachable at JVM level.
	Might need to create a Pointer class thats has a long localId and a WeakReference (or is a WeakReference?)
	to the λ which also knows its long localId, and use localId instead of == to compare and hashcode them.
	Or maybe this cache should prevent garbcol (not use any weakreference) and just watch the amount of memory
	and when it gets low garbcol from the low end of Ret.garbcolOrder.
	Also, must consider NIO memory (such as lwjgl opencl uses),
	but that can be isolated in MultiPool (or what was the "pool" class name in lazycl?)
	and in stack during OpenclUtil.callOpencl and .callOpenclDependnet and maybe in Mem.java instances.
